# Word-Devil ðŸ‘»

A spooky twist to the popular game Hangman, built using primitive Turbo C++ during my school days!

This was my first ever full-length coding project, and I got excited on stumbling upon the last traces of it today. We wrote every bit from scratch (back then I didn't realise you could google up code-bits or libraries when you were stuckðŸ«¤. I poured over textbooks instead!ðŸ˜Ž)

- SOFTWARE: Turbo C++

## About the Game

This is a game that breaks convention, and entertains players by calling out to their favourite ghosts characters of all time! ðŸ‘»

As the game is opened, a thematic and visually pleasing screen with Miss. Spooky the devil gliding across the page, greets the players.ðŸ˜ˆ It then proceeds to take
the players forward into the game. Yet another dynamic screen urges the players to the MENU screen, where players get to read the Rules, select their preferred theme of play, and enter the game. ðŸŽ®

Players key in their name and enter Level 1 after theyâ€™re assigned a unique Player ID by the
computer. As the game starts, the computer chooses a ghost name at random from a list of words already inputted. The player is then
challenged to guess the word, by guessing one letter at a time. Whenever he/she guesses a letter correctly, the played is awarded 10 points. ðŸŽ¯

However, if the letter guessed by the user is incorrect a devil is created.

The player has only 3 chances to guess the word. The player wins the
level when the user has guessed every letter in the
word, before he/she exhausts his lifelines. If the player fails to
do so, he/she loses. And the devil is formed fully! Muahaha ðŸ˜ˆ
The player then comes back to the MENU, where he/she can
play again or check the Score Board, where his/her
name might be displayed among the top 5 players'
score, had he/she scored high.


To highlight, this game is user-friendly. It stores all
its playerâ€™s details in a binary file. And after sorting
through the scores, it displays the top 5 playersâ€™
details. Its interactive manner urges user to keep
playing.
