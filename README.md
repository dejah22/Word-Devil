# Word-Devil ðŸ‘»
A spooky twist to the popular game Hangman, built using primitive Turbo C++ during my school days!

This was my first ever full-length coding project, and I got excited on stumbling upon the last traces of it today. We wrote every bit from scratch (back then I didn't realise you could google up code-bits or libraries when you were stuckðŸ«¤. I poured over textbooks instead!ðŸ˜Ž)
